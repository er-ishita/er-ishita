# hey there!! i’m **Ishita**🦋

💻 a cse student from *jiit, sector 62 noida* who loves creating, breaking, and rebuilding things just to see how they work.  
i’m all about learning— and sometimes by messing things up first! 

---

## 🚀 currently into
- 🧩 **C++ & OOP** (where logic meets chaos)
- 🌐 **web dev** — html, css, js, and all that fun front-end magic
- 🧠 **data structures & algorithms** (slowly but surely making peace with them)

---

## 🛠️ projects i’ve been building
- ✈️ **TripMate** – my very first web project that helps campus folks connect for trips; built with love, caffeine, and way too many commits 💬
- 🎬 **Netflix Talks** – a sleek streaming-inspired site where firebase meets movie magic    

---

## ✨ next on my list
- ⚛️ diving into **react** (because js wasn’t chaotic enough already)
- 💬 contributing to **open-source**
- 🎯 getting better at **competitive coding**
